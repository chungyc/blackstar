# Animation files are quite similar to scene files. The difference is that you
# can define multiple camera instances which are then fixed to certain points
# of time (normalized to [0, 1[). The frames in between are then generated by
# interpolating between the keyframes using the interpolation method of choice.

# Scene config is similar to the scene files
